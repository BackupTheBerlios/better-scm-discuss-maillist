Hi Amir!

Please suscribe to the mailing list to send subsequent messages there as 
messages send from non-subscribers need to be approved manually. It is very 
low volume and you can subscribe without receiving message. I am CCing my 
ClearCase champion.

Alastair, is it true?

Thanks for your contribution. I'll see what Alastair says and ammend the 
comparison accordingly.

It does, thank you. (because I work with ClearCase, and never got the chance
to play with UCM)

Joel


To sum it all up, Base ClearCase (which is what I mean by referring just to
ClearCase) is lacking some features, for which UCM is there to complement.

As UCM is part of the ClearCase distribution, it is appropriate to mention
UCM features in place of ClearCase in the Comparison, but UCM streams are
already mentioned there under Changesets' Support. Transactions in ClearCase
(atomic commits) will address the issue of, as you described it, half done
delivers. It must be agreed, then, that ClearCase supports neither
transactions nor atomic commits.

Hope I explained my point clearly.

I double checked my records now. There are no future plans for transaction
support in ClearCase, as far as I can tell. If I get any update on the
subject, I will let you know.
