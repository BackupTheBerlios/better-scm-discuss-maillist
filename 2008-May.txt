Subject: svn blame problem after merge
Message-ID: <533862.95698.qm@web50911.mail.re2.yahoo.com>


subversion has the svn blame problem. If you merge from a branch it does no longer show  where the code came from. Do you know of scm tools that do not have this problem ? Then I could import svn into the other one to get correct blame information. 

Kind Regards,
joe

Git, provided the svn importer can detect the merges.  Even if it does
not, you can manually declare "grafts" after conversion.

Then qgit or git-gui will help you with looking at the blame.

Hope this helps,

You might want to check into AccuRev if you can afford it. It has something that's a better than blame--a version slider which allows you to see changes to the code (and of course, the authors of those changes) over time by sliding the ruler around, and is hands-down the *best* tool I've EVER seen to implement branching & merging--it makes it VERY easy to branch & merge with their "streams" concept.http://www.accurev.com/images/screenshots/versionslider46.pnghttp://www.accurev.com/accurev-more.htmlJason-----Original Message-----From: better-scm-discuss-bounces at lists.berlios.de [mailto:better-scm-discuss-bounces at lists.berlios.de] On Behalf Of better-scm-discuss-request at lists.berlios.deSent: Friday, May 16, 2008 4:02 AMTo: better-scm-discuss at lists.berlios.deSubject: Better-scm-discuss Digest, Vol 5, Issue 1Send Better-scm-discuss mailing list submissions tobetter-scm-discuss at lists.berlios.de
