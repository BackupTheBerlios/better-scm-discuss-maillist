<PRE>This list hasn't seen any traffic for over a year, but since 
usually no-one unsubscribes from a list with no traffic, I hope 
someone will read this.


I am looking for a VCS that makes it easy to see who committed 
which revision and to be certain that this information is 
correct.

When I look at the commit log, I want to see at a glance who 
committed which revision. I want to be sure that those names 
displayed are really meaningful. That is, it should be guaranteed 
that in fact that person which I associate with the displayed 
name has committed the respective revision.

In Subversion, a centralized VCS, this can be ensured by 
correctly setting '--tunnel-user=USER' on the server, when using 
SSH. Then, a user authenticates himself by his SSH key, then the 
SSH server picks the corresponding entry in 
'~/.ssh/authorized_keys', and this will cause the intended user 
name to be recorded as the committer.

In a distributed VCS, this is no option since commits happen 
locally. Instead, revisions must be cryptographically signed.  
However, signing is not everything. In addition, signatures must 
be verified, and the commit log should reflect which commits have 
valid signatures and wich not.

I tested several systems in this respect without finding any 100% 
satisfactory solution.

Here is what I found:

- Mercurial provides an extension to explicitly sign certain 
  revisions. The act of signing creates a new revision by itself. 
  It seems like there is no way of automatically checking all 
  signatures or to detect revisions without signatures.

- Git only allows to sign tags and to verify those signatures on 
  demand.

- Monotone has mandatory signatures, which looks rather good to 
  me. However, the monotone server does not support encryption 
  and also does not seem to support SSH tunneling in a convenient 
  way (like most other systems, by calling 'ssh'), but only by a 
  &quot;real&quot; tunnel (opening a local port and such). So, 
  unfortunately, monotone is ruled out by this other criterion.

- Bazaar can sign revisions, and it can be told to sign each and 
  every revision upon commit. However, I did not find any 
  built-in way to check signatures. There is an option 
  'check_signatures' which can be set to 'required', but I could 
  not find out what it does actually. It is not documented.

  There is a plugin for Bazaar, however, with which one can get 
  statistics on how many revisions are signed and which 
  signatures cause problems. When this statistics says that 
  everything is signed and okay, then one can trust the user 
  names in the commit log.

Bottom line is that Bazaar is closest to my needs, but not yet 100%.

Suggestions?

Thank you!
Lasse
