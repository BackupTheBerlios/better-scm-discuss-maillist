If you're only relying on an ssh tunnel for svn, I suppose it should
be OK for you as well to use this mechanism with a DSCM.  If so,
gitosis provides the necessay infrastucture to do so comfortably on
top of git (gitosis upstream does not seem very active, but there is
at least one gentoo person writing patches, and I registered a mirror
of his repository as a fork on <A HREF="http://repo.or.cz/w/gitosis.git.">http://repo.or.cz/w/gitosis.git.</A>  FWIW,
I have started to make a couple of cleanups of this code recently, and
will push them as another fork shortly).

OTOH, it does enforce a centralized verification scheme.  If you want
something more flexible, I believe that could easily be done on top of
commit notes (development for that feature has unfortunately stalled
AFAIK).  I'm cc'ing the git list so others have the opportunity to
comment.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tested several systems in this respect without finding any 100% 
</I>&gt;<i> satisfactory solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is what I found:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Mercurial provides an extension to explicitly sign certain 
</I>&gt;<i>   revisions. The act of signing creates a new revision by itself. 
</I>&gt;<i>   It seems like there is no way of automatically checking all 
</I>&gt;<i>   signatures or to detect revisions without signatures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Git only allows to sign tags and to verify those signatures on 
</I>&gt;<i>   demand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Monotone has mandatory signatures, which looks rather good to 
</I>&gt;<i>   me. However, the monotone server does not support encryption 
</I>&gt;<i>   and also does not seem to support SSH tunneling in a convenient 
</I>&gt;<i>   way (like most other systems, by calling 'ssh'), but only by a 
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;real&quot; tunnel (opening a local port and such). So, 
</I>&gt;<i>   unfortunately, monotone is ruled out by this other criterion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Bazaar can sign revisions, and it can be told to sign each and 
</I>&gt;<i>   every revision upon commit. However, I did not find any 
</I>&gt;<i>   built-in way to check signatures. There is an option 
</I>&gt;<i>   'check_signatures' which can be set to 'required', but I could 
</I>&gt;<i>   not find out what it does actually. It is not documented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   There is a plugin for Bazaar, however, with which one can get 
</I>&gt;<i>   statistics on how many revisions are signed and which 
</I>&gt;<i>   signatures cause problems. When this statistics says that 
</I>&gt;<i>   everything is signed and okay, then one can trust the user 
</I>&gt;<i>   names in the commit log.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bottom line is that Bazaar is closest to my needs, but not yet 100%.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you!
</I>&gt;<i> Lasse
